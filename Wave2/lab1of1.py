#Quiz: List Indexing
#Use list indexing to determine how many days are in a particular month based on the integer variable month, and store that value in the integer variable num_days. For example, if month is 8, num_days should be set to 31, since the eighth month, August, has 31 days.




month = 8
days_in_month = [31,28,31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31]

num_days = days_in_month[7] * month

print(num_days)
